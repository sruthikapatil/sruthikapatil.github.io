        Here is some recent information about the soybean market in India: 
 
Production
In the 2024/2025 marketing year, India's soybean production is estimated to be 12.9 million metric tons (MMT). However, the 2023-24 forecast suggests a potential decrease in soybean output due to rainfall deficits. 
 
Soybean meal
In January 2024, the average price of soybean meal in India was around â‚¹41,000 per tonne. The supply of soybean meal was tight due to lower imports and reduced domestic crushing. Demand from the poultry and aquaculture sectors remained steady, while demand from the dairy sector softened slightly. 
 
Soybean oil imports
For the 2024/2025 marketing year, India's soybean oil imports are projected at 3.7 MMT. 
 
Soybean exports
India exports soybean meal mainly to Southeast Asia. In 2022-23, Vietnam was the largest buyer of soybean meal from India, followed by Japan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. 
 
Soybean cultivation
The area under soybean cultivation has grown from 10.3 million hectares in 2017-18 to 12.5 million hectares in 2023-24.
