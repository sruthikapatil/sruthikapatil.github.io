  Soybean products have many advantages, including: 
 
Bone health
Soybean oil contains vitamin K, which helps control bone metabolism and synthesize proteins that maintain bone mass. 
 
Menopausal symptoms
Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are hormone-like substances that may help reduce menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. 
 
Cholesterol
Soy foods are low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and high in fiber and polyunsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol. 
 
Omega-3 fatty acids
Soybean oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can help promote health and prevent chronic disease. 
 
Reduced inflammation
Isoflavones in soy can reduce chronic inflammation, which may help prevent chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. 
 
However, some people have concerns about soy products, including antinutrients, phytoestrogens, and genetic modification. However, evidence shows that soy foods are generally safe. If you're concerned, you can opt for non-GMO or organic soy products.
