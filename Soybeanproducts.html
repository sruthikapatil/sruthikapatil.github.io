 * Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are hormone-like substances that may help reduce menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. <br>

  * Soybean oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can help promote health and prevent chronic disease. <br>

        genetic modification. However, evidence shows that soy foods are generally safe. If you're concerned, <br>
