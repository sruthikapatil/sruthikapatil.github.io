        Here are some products made from soybeans:

Tofu can be baked, broiled, grilled, fried, or eaten raw. <br>

and heart-protective properties. <br>

        nutty, earthy flavor.

30 days before the pods turn brown and become dry. 
 

Soy nuts-

        Soybeans that are soaked in water, drained, and<br>

        then baked or roasted. They can be used in place of nuts. <br>

        A brown, salty liquid condiment made by fermenting<br>

        soybeans or breaking them down with acid. <br>
 

Soy flour-

        A gluten-free flour derived from ground soybeans that <br>

        can be used in baked goods like cookies and quick breads. <br>
 

  Soybean products have many advantages, including: 
 
Bone health-

        Soybean oil contains vitamin K, which helps control bone <br>

        metabolism and synthesize proteins that maintain bone mass. <br>
 
Menopausal symptoms-

        Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are hormone-like substances <br>

        that may help reduce menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. <br>
 
Cholesterol-

        Soy foods are low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and high<br>

        in fiber and polyunsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol. <br>
 
Omega-3 fatty acids-

        Soybean oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can help promote health<br>

        and prevent chronic disease. <br>
 
Reduced inflammation-

        Isoflavones in soy can reduce chronic inflammation, which may help prevent<br>

        chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. <br>
 
However, some people have concerns about soy products, including <br>

        antinutrients, phytoestrogens, and genetic modification. However, <br>

        evidence shows that soy foods are generally safe. If you're concerned, <br>

        you can opt for non-GMO or organic soy products. <br>
