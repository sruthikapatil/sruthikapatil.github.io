Here are some things to consider when harvesting soybeans: <br>
 
When to harvest-

Soybeans are ready to harvest when the leaves turn brown and fall off,<br>
        
exposing the matured pods. The ideal time to harvest is when the pods<br>
        
are pale yellow and the moisture content is around 13%. Harvesting too<br>
        
early can result in immature beans, while harvesting too late can lead<br>
to shattering losses. 
 
Harvesting equipment-

Combines are used to harvest soybeans. The header on the front of the <br>
        
combine cuts and collects the plants, and the combine separates the <br>

soybeans from the pods and stems. The combine operator then empties the<br>

soybeans into a grain truck or wagon. 
 
Harvesting tips -
 
Drive slowly, at a speed of 3â€“4 miles per hour. <br>
 
Set the concave clearance and cylinder speed to avoid cracking the seeds. <br>
 
Synchronize the reel speed and ground travel speed to avoid cutter-bar shatter. <br>
 
Cut as low to the ground as possible to capture low pods. <br>
 
Check for losses on the ground. <br>
 
Use an air reel to keep the knife cleaner. <br>
 
Soybean storage-

Most grain elevators won't accept soybeans with a moisture content above 13%.<br>
        
If the moisture content is too low, there  will be increased shatter loss </p>
