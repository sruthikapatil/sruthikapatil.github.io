    Here are some things to consider when harvesting soybeans: <br>
 
  1. When to harvest-<br>

 * Soybeans are ready to harvest when the leaves turn brown and fall off,exposing the matured pods.s<br>
        
  * The ideal time to harvest is when the podsare pale yellow and the moisture content is around 13%.<br>
        
   * Harvesting too early can result in immature beans, while harvesting too late can lead to shattering losses. <br>
 
2.  Harvesting equipment-<br>
        
   * Combines are used to harvest soybeans. s<br>
        
    *The header on the front of the  combine cuts and collects the plants, and the combine separates thes<br>  

        soybeans from the pods and stems.<br>
        
   *  The combine operator then empties the soybeans into a grain truck or wagon. <br>
 
3. Harvesting tips -<br>

  * Drive slowly, at a speed of 3â€“4 miles per hour. <br>
 
  *  Set the concave clearance and cylinder speed to avoid cracking the seeds. <br>
 
  *  Synchronize the reel speed and ground travel speed to avoid cutter-bar shatter. <br>
 
*  Cut as low to the ground as possible to capture low pods. <br>
 
* Check for losses on the ground. <br>
 
* Use an air reel to keep the knife cleaner. <br>
 
4. Soybean storage- <br>

* Most grain elevators won't accept soybeans with a moisture content above 13%.<br>
        
* If the moisture content is too low, there  will be increased shatter loss, splits,and weightloss <br>
