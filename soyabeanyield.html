* Soybean yields can vary widely depending on several factors, including: <br>
 
1. Water availability-
Under rainfed conditions, good soybean yields are between 1.5 and 2.5 tons per hectare (ton/ha) of seed. <br>
 
2 .Irrigation-
High yields of improved varieties are between 2.5 and 3.5 ton/ha of seed under irrigation. <br>
 
3. Fertilization-
The content of zinc, copper, phosphorus, sulfur, and potassium in the soil can affect soybean yield. <br>
 
4. Planting date-
The date of planting controls solar radiation capture and water availability, which are the main predictors of soybean yield. <br>
 
5. Soil depth-
The A horizon depth and total soil depth can affect soybean yield. <br>
 
* The global average soybean yield has increased from around 1,128 to around 2,769 kg haâ€“1 over the past 60 years. <br>
 
* The average soybean yield per acre in the United States from 2018 to 2022 was 47.0 bushels per acre. The yield varies by farm, <br>
 
      with the average yield for a typical Canadian farm being 34.4 bushels per acre and the average yield for a typical Indiana farm being 58.3 bushels per acre. <br>
 
*   The USDA projects that the 2024 U.S. soybean yield will be 53.2 bushels per acre, based on 86.3 million harvested acres. <br>
 
     Soybean yield is influenced by a number of factors, including: <br>
 
 1. Genetics-
      Improvements in genetics have contributed to the increase in soybean yields in the U.S. over the past 50 years. <br>
 
2. Management-
    Management practices can also contribute to increased yields. For example, applying herbicides before the soybeans<br>
 
     emerge can prevent weeds from stealing nutrients, light, and moisture from the crop. <br>
 
3. Number of nodes-
   The number of nodes a soybean plant develops is closely linked to its yield potential. <br>
 
    Nodes are the parts of the plant where leaves are attached to the stem. <br>
 
4. Variety -
   Different varieties of soybeans have varying maturity periods and different levels of resistance to pests, diseases, and insects. <br>
 
  Farmers can grow multiple varieties with different maturity periods to reduce the risk of yield reduction due to climate or biotic factors. <br>
