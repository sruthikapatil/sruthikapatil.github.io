Introduction
Soybeans are legumes related to peas, clover and alfalfa. <br>
Soybeans are dicots, which means they have two cotyledons.<br>
Each soybean plant produces 60 to 80 pods, each holding three pea-sized beans.<br>
Soybeans are hardy plants and well adapted to a variety of soils and soil conditions.<br>
Soybeans are slower growing than most garden beans, requiring warmer weather and about 3 to 5 months for maturity.<br>


Cotyledon: A cotyledon stores food for the developing embryo and is the first part of the plant that emerges from the soil.<br>
