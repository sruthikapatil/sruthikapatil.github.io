                                        Information-<br>
      &nbsp;

        * Soybeans are legumes related to peas, clover and alfalfa. <br>
         &nbsp;

* Soybeans are dicots, which means they have two cotyledons.<br>
         &nbsp;

* Each soybean plant produces 60 to 80 pods, each holding three pea-sized beans.<br>
         &nbsp;

* Soybeans are hardy plants and well adapted to a variety of soils and soil conditions.<br>
         &nbsp;

* Soybeans are slower growing than most garden beans, requiring warmer weather and about 3 to 5 months for maturity.<br>
         &nbsp;


        Cotyledon: 'A cotyledon stores food for the developing embryo and is the first part of the plant that emerges from the soil'.<br>
         &nbsp;

        
* Soybean has a complex genome because multiple neopolyploid speciation events superimposed <br>
 &nbsp;

    0n the paleopolyploid genome (Shoemaker, Schlueter, & Doyle, 2006). <br>
         &nbsp;

* Given the importance of soybean, its genome was sequenced by a whole-genome <br>
         &nbsp;

  * shotgun approach and assembled with physical and high-density genetic maps (Schmutz et al., 2010).<br>
         &nbsp;

  * It was demonstrated that most genome sequence was assembled into 20 chromosomes and 46,430 protein-coding <br>
         &nbsp;

  * genes were predicated (Schmutz et al., 2010). High-resolution genetic linkage maps challenged the false joins <br>
         &nbsp;

  * or misplaced scaffolds and unanchored scaffolds to improve the soybean genome sequence (Song et al., 2016).<br>
         &nbsp;

  * The information of soybean genome facilitated the genetic and genomic research. These findings indicate the complexity <br>
   &nbsp;

        of soybean genome and contribute to biological studies in soybean.<br>
