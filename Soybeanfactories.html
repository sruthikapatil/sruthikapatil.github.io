        The steps involved in processing soybeans in a factory are: 
 
Cleaning: The first step is to clean the soybeans to remove foreign matter like <br>

stems, pods, and leaves. This improves the quality of the oil and reduces wear and <br>

tear on processing equipment. 
 

Dehulling: The soybean hulls are removed because they absorb oil and reduce the yield. <br>
 
Crushing: The soybeans are conditioned, sorted, and crushed. The seeds are then flaked. <br>
 
Solvent extraction: The flakes are treated with a solvent to extract the oil. <br>
 
Refining: The extracted oil is refined to remove impurities through degumming, <br> 

deacidification, decolorization, and deodorization. 
 
Oil filtration: The oil is filtered. 
 
After the oil filter process, the next steps in soybean processing are to refine<br>

the oil to improve its flavor, odor, color, and stability: 
 
Degumming-

Removes phosphatides from the crude soybean oil to improve its physical stability <br>
 
Gums conditioning and neutralization-

Treats degummed oil with phosphoric acid to convert non-hydratable phosphorus into <br>

hydratable form 
 
Bleaching-

Removes contaminants such as color pigments, polycyclic aromatic compounds, dirt, <br>

traces of metals, phospholipids, and several other impurities <br>
 
Deodorization-
    
Removes numerous volatile components through a vacuum stripping process <br>
 
Packaging-
        
The refined soyabean oil is packed in pouches, bottles, cans, and<br>

containers of different capacities .
