        The steps involved in processing soybeans in a factory are: 
 
Cleaning: The first step is to clean the soybeans to remove foreign matter like stems, pods, and leaves. This improves the quality of the oil and reduces wear and tear on processing equipment. 
 
Dehulling: The soybean hulls are removed because they absorb oil and reduce the yield. 
 
Crushing: The soybeans are conditioned, sorted, and crushed. The seeds are then flaked. 
 
Solvent extraction: The flakes are treated with a solvent to extract the oil. 
 
Refining: The extracted oil is refined to remove impurities through degumming, deacidification, decolorization, and deodorization. 
 
Oil filtration: The oil is filtered. 
 
After the oil filter process, the next steps in soybean processing are to refine the oil to improve its flavor, odor, color, and stability: 
 
Degumming
Removes phosphatides from the crude soybean oil to improve its physical stability 
 
Gums conditioning and neutralization
Treats degummed oil with phosphoric acid to convert non-hydratable phosphorus into hydratable form 
 
Bleaching
Removes contaminants such as color pigments, polycyclic aromatic compounds, dirt, traces of metals, phospholipids, and several other impurities 
 
Deodorization
Removes numerous volatile components through a vacuum stripping process 
 
Packaging
The refined soyabean oil is packed in pouches, bottles, cans, and containers of different capacities
