        The steps involved in processing soybeans in a factory are: <br>
 
1.Cleaning:<br> 
        
  * The first step is to clean the soybeans to remove foreign matter like stems, pods, and leaves. <br>                                   <br>

  *  This improves the quality of the oil and reduces wear and tear on processing equipment. <br> 
 

2. Dehulling:<br> 
        
       * The soybean hulls are removed because they absorb oil and reduce the yield. <br>
 
3. Crushing: <br> 
        
      *  The soybeans are conditioned, sorted, and crushed. The seeds are then flaked. <br>
 
4. Solvent extraction: <br> 
        
     *   The flakes are treated with a solvent to extract the oil. <br>
 
5. Refining:<br>
        
        * The extracted oil is refined to remove impurities through degumming, <br> 

            deacidification, decolorization, and deodorization. <br> 
 
6.  Oil filtration:<br> 
        
       * The oil is filtered. <br> 
 
        * After the oil filter process, the next steps in soybean processing are to refine<br>

the oil to improve its flavor, odor, color, and stability: <br> 
 
1. Degumming-<br> 

* Removes phosphatides from the crude soybean oil to improve its physical stability <br>
 
2. Gums conditioning and neutralization-<br> 

* Treats degummed oil with phosphoric acid to convert non-hydratable phosphorus into <br>

* hydratable form <br> 
 
1 .Bleaching-<br> 

*Removes contaminants such as color pigments, polycyclic aromatic compounds, dirt, <br>

     traces of metals, phospholipids, and several other impurities <br>
 
2. Deodorization-<br> 
    
*Removes numerous volatile components through a vacuum stripping process <br>
 
3. Packaging-<br> 
        
* The refined soyabean oil is packed in pouches, bottles, cans, and<br>

      containers of different capacities .<br>
