How To Plant Soybeans

There are several steps and processes involved in planting soybeans.<br>

Below, we’ll break down the most crucial aspects of each so you can grow yield and economic return.<br>

Pre-Planting Operations

Seed treatment with pesticides and fungicides is usually recommended.<br>

Before planting, make sure the seeds don’t contain any of these chemicals. <br>

It’s noteworthy that the tillage method has no bearing on crop harvest.<br>

No-till soybean planting is an efficient and cost-effective alternative to conventional tillage methods .<br>

Best Time To Plant Soybeans

They should be planted in the late winter or early spring, when the soil temperature grows to 60°F (15°C), in frost-free regions. <br>

The same soil temperature for planting soybeans two to three weeks following the last frost date is ideal in cooler climates. <br> 

Delayed soybean planting dates might lead to shorter plants and lower pod formation, both of which hinder harvesting.<br>

Late-planted soybeans have a greater risk of being damaged by fall frost, further reducing crop output.<br>

How Long Does It Take To Grow Soybeans?

They require anywhere from 100 to 130 days or more to complete their full growth cycle.<br>

Because day length affects plant development, longer days can delay flowering in short-day types<br>

and lead them to grow in height and node number. <br>

Meanwhile, shorter days accelerate flowering, even more so for late-maturing types.<br>

There are more environmental conditions that influence soybean growing time. <br>

Insects, crop diseases, a lack of sunlight, and dry spells during the grain fill stage<br>

can all affect the plants’ health and thus the time it takes for them to grow mature.<br>
