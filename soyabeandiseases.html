Soybeans are susceptible to many diseases, including: <br>
 
    1. Early-season diseases-<br>

* These include seed decay, seedling blights, and root rots.<br>

* They are caused by fungi in the soil, such as Pythium, <br>

* Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium. <br>
 
2 . Foliar diseases-<br>

* These include bacterial blight, bacterial pustule, brown spot,<br>

        downy mildew, frogeye leaf spot, Cercospora leaf blight, and soybean rust. <br>
 
3.  Viral diseases-<br>

*  These include bean pod mottle virus and soybean mosaic virus. <br> 

* Symptoms include mottled, crinkled leaves, mottled seed, and lower yields. <br>
 
4.  Green stem disorder-<br>

* This disorder affects the normal maturation of stem tissue. <br>

*  Symptoms include fewer pods, and leaves or petioles may remain attached to the plant. <br>
 
5 . Some ways to manage soybean diseases include:<br> 
 
 1. Crop rotation -<br>
 
  * Selecting soybean varieties that are resistant to local diseases <br>
 
   2. Cultural management -<br>
 
   *  Chemical management, which may vary depending on the pathogen and environmental conditions <br>


   6. To control diseases use following steps <br>
 
     Here are some ways to control soybean diseases: <br>
 
    1. Plant disease-resistant varieties:<br>

*  Choose a variety that is resistant to the diseases that are common in your area. <br>
 
2. Use fungicide:<br>

 *Apply fungicide to the seeds or to the leaves of the plants. <br>
                                                                              
* Fungicides with multiple modes of action are best. <br>
 
3. Rotate crops: <br>

 * Rotate soybeans with crops that are not susceptible to the same diseases,<br>

      such as maize or sorghum. This breaks the disease cycle. <br>
  
4. Scout for disease:<br>  
 
 * Regularly inspect your soybeans for signs of disease. <br>
 
5.  Manage weeds:<br>
 
 * Weeds can help spread disease, so it's important to manage them. <br>
 
  *  Improve soil drainage: Install subsurface tile to improve drainage. <br>
 
6. Bury plant residue: <br>
 
 * After harvest, plow the field to bury plant residue com pletely. <br>
 
 7. Keep records:<br>
 
 * Keep a record of when and how severe diseases have occurred in your fields.<br> 

*  This can help you decide how to manage the disease in the future. <br>
