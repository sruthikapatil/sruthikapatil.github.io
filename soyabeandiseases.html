Soybeans are susceptible to many diseases, including: <br>
 
# soyabeandiseases
 
 Early-season diseases-

These include seed decay, seedling blights, and root rots.<br>

They are caused by fungi in the soil, such as Pythium, <br>

Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium. <br>
 
Foliar diseases-

These include bacterial blight, bacterial pustule, brown spot,<br>

downy mildew, frogeye leaf spot, Cercospora leaf blight, and soybean rust. <br>
 
Viral diseases-

These include bean pod mottle virus and soybean mosaic virus. <br> 

Symptoms include mottled, crinkled leaves, mottled seed, and lower yields. <br>
 
Green stem disorder-

This disorder affects the normal maturation of stem tissue. <br>

Symptoms include fewer pods, and leaves or petioles may remain attached to the plant. <br>
 
Some ways to manage soybean diseases include: 
 
Crop rotation -
 
Selecting soybean varieties that are resistant to local diseases <br>
 
Cultural management -
 
Chemical management, which may vary depending on the pathogen and environmental conditions <br>


To control diseases use following steps <br>
 
Here are some ways to control soybean diseases: <br>
 
Plant disease-resistant varieties:<br>

Choose a variety that is resistant to the diseases that are common in your area. <br>
 
Use fungicide: Apply fungicide to the seeds or to the leaves of the plants. <br>
                                                                              
Fungicides with multiple modes of action are best. <br>
 
Rotate crops: Rotate soybeans with crops that are not susceptible to the same diseases,<br>

such as maize or sorghum. This breaks the disease cycle. <br>
 
Scout for disease: Regularly inspect your soybeans for signs of disease. <br>
 
Manage weeds: Weeds can help spread disease, so it's important to manage them. <br>
 
Improve soil drainage: Install subsurface tile to improve drainage. <br>
 
Bury plant residue: After harvest, plow the field to bury plant residue completely. <br>
 
Keep records: Keep a record of when and how severe diseases have occurred in your fields.<br> 

This can help you decide how to manage the disease in the future. <br>
